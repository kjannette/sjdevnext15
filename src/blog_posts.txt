Title:  Effective AI Coding Prompts: Build a React login page in three minutes

Content: This is the first installment in an instructive series in prompt engineering technique.  

We’ll begin with a practical example, by building a common frontend component: a Javascript/React login page. Later posts
in the series will explore backend services, tooling, scripting and will contrast/compare specific LLMs.  

First, some high-level considerations (with a deeper dive into each point, below):  

Prompts should be expressed  in, and seek to induce, step-by-step, chain of thought reasoning. 

1. Hierarchical structure is key.  Prompts should be composed top-down.  First think on the highest level, and deconstruct the task into discrete, bite-sized tasks.

2. Precision is key. Prompts should encompass each step of a task as concisely as possible. 

3. Semantics are key. Segment prompts the way you separate concerns.  Think about prompting the way you think about design: each section addresses a specific, self-contained feature with as little overlap as possible.

In other words, when composing prompts, deconstruct the task into bite-sized commands that reflect the discrete structure and purpose of each module, method 
or class.

This step involves asking yourself questions.  The answers will define the problem.

What exactly **is** a  React  login page? **What does it do**, and what are **the minimal things** it 
needs in order to do that? For illustrative purposes (we won’t get fancy yet), we’ll stick to the 
barest possible combination of necessary elements to "get the job done” of logging 
users in.  

A login page is (minimally):

1. A discrete React component.

2. Exported into a larger component hierarchy.

3. That incorporates specific jsx DOM elements, such as, minimally:

    a. A header <h1>with a title, i.e. “Login Page” or “Please enter username and password”.
    
    b. Form inputs for username and password.
    
    c. A submit button.

4. That also incorporates methods to perform tasks, for example:

    a. A “handle submit” function that is called when the submit button is clicked.
    
    b. A method to validate our user’s input to the form.
    
    c. Methods to make HTTP requests (sending the credentials to the backend for authentication) and process the responses.
    
    d. A method to navigate to the next page (if the login is successful).

    c. Other means (i.e., "onClick" functions) that navigate to/away from the page, i.e. if the user doesn't want to log in.

5. That imports a CSS file for (in this case, basic) styling.

6. That incorporates the navigation in the UI.

Now that we have an understanding of our requirements, we can create a series of prompts.  The below assumes you have created a root project folder with the necessary dependencies (i.e. NPM, React) installed.

**Prompt 1 – Define the task and constraints**

I want you to build a single React page component that will act as a “Login” page for the UI of 

customer service application.

Requirements:

* Use React functional components.

* Style with plain CSS in a separate file, no CSS frameworks at this time.

* The page must include:

    * A placeholder header area at the top of the page.
    * A simple form with two inputs: “User Name” and “Password”.
    * A “Submit” button.

* This page must be treated as a route in a React Router setup.

* There will be a navigation bar at the top that lets the user navigate to this page and away from it. 

* To start, make a “Home” link and a “Login” link.  Those will be separate, reusable components we create in a later step.

First, think step-by-step and describe the architecture and file structure you plan to use (e.g. App, router setup, LoginPage, Navbar, CSS files).

Then, stop and wait for my confirmation or instructions before writing any code.
