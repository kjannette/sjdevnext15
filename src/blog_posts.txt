Content: This is the first installment in an instructive series on prompt engineering.  

We’ll begin with a practical example, by building a common frontend component: a Javascript/React login page. 

Aside Start:

Note: for purposes of the below illustration, we assume that the project's necessary dependencies (i.e. React, React Router) are installed and the highest-order React component, the App (which renders all others), already exists.

Aside End:

Later posts in the series will explore backend services, tooling, scripting and will contrast/compare specific LLMs.  

First, some high-level considerations (with a deeper dive into each point, below).   

Prompts should be expressed  in, and seek to induce, step-by-step, chain of thought reasoning. 

1. Hierarchical structure is key.  Prompts should be composed top-down.  First think on the highest level, and deconstruct the task into discrete, bite-sized tasks. 

2. Precision is key. Prompts should encompass each step of a task as concisely as possible. 

3. Semantics are key. Segment prompts the way you separate concerns.  Think about prompting the way you think about design: each section addresses a specific, self-contained feature with as little overlap as possible.

In other words, when composing prompts, deconstruct the task into bite-sized commands that reflect the discrete structure and purpose of each module, 
class or method.

This step involves asking yourself questions.  The answers will define the problem.

What exactly **is** a  React  login page? **What does it do**, and what are **the minimal things** it 
needs in order to do that? 

For illustrative purposes (we won’t get fancy yet), we’ll stick to the barest possible combination of necessary elements to "get the job done” of logging 
users in.  

A login page is (minimally):

1. A discrete React component.

2. Exported into a larger component hierarchy.

3. That incorporates specific jsx DOM elements, such as (minimally):

    a. A header <h1>with a title, i.e. “Login Page” or “Please enter username and password”.
    
    b. Form inputs for username and password.
    
    c. A submit button.

4. That also incorporates methods to perform tasks, for example:

    a. A “handle submit” function that is called when the submit button is clicked.
    
    b. A method to validate our user’s input to the form.
    
    c. Methods to make HTTP requests (sending the credentials to the backend for authentication) and process the responses.
    
    d. A method to navigate to the next page (if the login is successful).

    c. Other means (i.e., "onClick" functions) that navigate to/away from the page, i.e. if the user doesn't want to log in.

5. That imports a CSS file for (in this case, basic) styling.

6. That incorporates the navigation in the UI.

Now that we have an understanding of our requirements, we can create a series of prompts. 

**Prompt 1 – Define the task and constraints**

I want you to build a login page component for a React customer service application. It should be exported to, and incorporated in, the existing parent App component.

Requirements:

1. Use React functional components.

2. Style with plain CSS in a separate file, no CSS frameworks at this time.

3. This page must be treated as a route in a React Router setup.

4. There will be a navigation bar at the top that lets the user navigate to this page and away from it, with a "home" link and a "login" link.

5. The login page must include:

    a. A placeholder header area at the top of the page.
    
    b. A simple form with two inputs: "User Name" and "Password".
    
    c. A "submit" button.

First, think step-by-step and describe the architecture, file structure, methods and other details you will implement. Then, stop and wait for my confirmation or instructions before writing any code.

**This "pause and review" step is critical.** 

It prevents the AI from running ahead and making assumptions about what you want, gives you control over direction, and creates checkpoints where you can course-correct. 

Reviewing the output takes only seconds, but it's the difference between collaboration — where you guide the process iteratively — and delegation, where you hope the AI reads your mind. 

Aside Start:

**The most common source of "garbage" output is failure to guide the process and catch:**  

1. Incomplete Context Loading - When the LLM doesn't read ALL relevant files before starting, and works with assumptions.

2. Jumping to Solutions Too Quickly - LLMs pattern-match -- it's how they work -- but sometimes they do so without fully understanding YOUR specific setup.  Therefore, LLMs might implement before validating assumptions against the actual codebase.

3. Not Verifying Changes - Ideally, LLMs should "proof read" sections after edits, but ensuring that happens is up to you.

4. Missing the Forest for the Trees - LLMs can get hyperfocused on code details and miss simple structural requirements.

Aside End:

Including the "pause and review" step keeps the process supervised and on track. The best results come from treating your AI like a skilled, but overzealous, colleague: explain the plan, confirm understanding, then oversee execution details.

Content:  This post builds on the output from the above prompt, adding a second prompt to build what we defined with our LLM, above.

**Prompt 2 – Create basic component (no styling yet)**

That structure and approach is acceptable, keep it in mind as we move forward and make sure, as we build, our additions conform to it.  We will proceed with the plan in carefully executed phases.  The following instructions are for the second  phase - follow, but do not exceed them.

Think step-by-step and implement the components and functionality below, in the numbered order, explaining your plan concisely before writing each numbered item:

1. React Router functionality in the App component, which defines two routes:
    a. / for a basic "Home" page (we will build it later).
    b. /login for the new "Login" page.
2. The Login page component, containing:
    a. A placeholder header area.
    b. A form with: an input for "User Name", an input for "Password", and a submit button.
2. A separate Navbar component that is imported into the Login page and appears at the top, with navigation links to “Home” and “Login,” using React Router navigation.

Do not add any complex styling yet; keep JSX simple. Do not create functions for processing the form data input.  Pause after completion of the above steps for review and next instructions.

Give the output a quick inspection, just like a PR review and make corrections if needed, either manually or with brief follow-up prompts.

We will proceed with the implementation in the next post.
